<p>At RAMM, we pride ourselves on offering an off the shelf pricing service whereby the customer can select the services they want and simply check out. Our off the shelf services cover the majority of needs, but you may find that you need something we don’t offer on the site.  If you think we can do it, we probably can. Send us a message with your requirements and we will tell you what we can do and give you a no-obligation quote. The following are examples of previous work that we have completed that was not advertised on the site:</p>

  
      <br>
        
        <h2>Tech Dinosaur</h2>
<br>
        
        <p>Tech Dinosaur is a popular technology-based online entertainment network that publishes content to a wide audience. This takes the form of video, blog posts and social network feeds that supply regular news, reviews, tutorials, unboxings and competitions. Matt (Founder) wanted to have a number of backgrounds designed for the Tech Dinosaur social network pages. He noticed that Google+ was not included in the Social Media Area, so he contacted us and asked if we could design some media for his page. RAMM were more than happy to fulfil his demands.</p>

        <h2>OTR - Off The Rails</h2>
<br>
        
        <p>OTR is a Sheffield-based events management and promotion company, concentrating on promoting trance-based nightclub events. They wanted to have some posters designed to fit on advertising boards around the city, which were considerably larger than the A0 poster designs offered on the website. After some consultation, we then offered OTR a quote for the bigger sized poster. RAMM were more than happy to fulfil their demands.</p>
        
        
        
       
        
        
        <br>
       
        
        <h2>Pounding Panda</h2>
        <br>

        <p>The Pounding Panda gaming team were looking to promote their online content to people on the high street. They wanted to effectively display their brand image and make sure that it was recognisable and had an impact on passers-by. Arron from Pounding Panda emailed us to see if we could produce a t-shirt design so he could take it to his local clothing printer. RAMM were more than happy to fulfil his demands.</p>
        
       
       <br>
        
        
        <h2>MiTech</h2>
        <br>
        <p>MiTech is a start up technology based channel that publishes content on Youtube, Facebook and Tumblr. Michael, the founder of Mitech was looking into a background design for his Tumblr page. Michael noticed that RAMM did not advertise Tumblr designs, so he got in touch with us and asked if we could design a background for his page. RAMM were more than happy to fulfil his demands.</p>
