===========

Context
===========
<hr>
You are a group of entrepreneurs. You are thinking of creating an E-Commerce venture and at the present time you are carrying out the preliminary studies. Your studies are preliminary because at this stage they do not include financial forecasting though you do realise that you have to do this before you approach a venture capitalist for finance.<br>
 <br>
Outcomes
===========
<hr>
*A business plan report<br>
*A web-based, interactive prototype<br>
<br>
Checking out and running the project
===========
<hr>
Some info here about how to run the project<br>
<br>
*The project needs a running local mysql database called rammdesignsdb and by default connects to the database using a user called rammdesigns and a password of rammdesigns. Obviously this should be changed in a production environment.<br>
<br>
*The MySQL create database command should be create database rammdesignsdb default charset utf8 default collate utf8_bin; The character set encoding is important as the web application is capable of accepting UTF8 input.<br>
<br>
*The project is a groovy/grails project and needs an installed Java7 JDK and installed grails SDK (http://www.grails.org)<br>
